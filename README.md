## AI-Driven Business Intelligence Dashboard
A business analytics dashboard that uses machine learning and statistical analysis to help companies make data-driven decisions.

# Problem It Solves:
Many businesses struggle to analyze their data effectively to make accurate predictions or gain insights. Your system would:
    • Forecast sales using time series models.
    • Detect credit risk using classification models.
    • Find hidden patterns in customer behavior using clustering techniques.
    • Analyze product performance using regression models.
    • Assess factors affecting business success using factor analysis.

# How It Works (Visualizing It in Action)
A business uploads its dataset, and your system:
✅ Generates insights—e.g., why sales are fluctuating, whether a customer is likely to default on a loan, or how different product features affect demand.
✅ Predicts future trends—e.g., forecasting next month’s sales based on historical data.
✅ Classifies customers—e.g., whether a customer is high risk or low risk.
✅ Clusters similar customers—e.g., grouping them based on purchasing behavior.
✅ Provides interactive visualizations—showing charts, graphs, and AI-driven recommendations.

Tech Stack & Implementation Plan
    1. Backend (Python, Django, FastAPI) – Handles data processing, ML model execution, and API requests.
    2. Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Statsmodels, SHAP, Time Series Models) – Implements regression, classification, clustering, and forecasting.
    3. Database (PostgreSQL) – Stores datasets and insights.
    4. Frontend (React.js) – Provides an interactive UI for visualizing data and results.
    5. Deployment (Docker) – Deploy the app for users to access.
